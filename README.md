## Checks

Every push runs `.github/workflows/check.yml`:

- `php -l` on every PHP file under PHP 7.2 and 8.4
- PHP_CodeSniffer with `phpcs.xml.dist`: PHP 7.2+ compatibility (PHPCompatibilityWP) plus WordPress security sniffs (output escaping, nonces, input sanitizing, prepared SQL, deprecated functions)

Run the same locally with `phpcs` from the repo root once WPCS and PHPCompatibilityWP are installed.
